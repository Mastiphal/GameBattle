# GameBattle
A simple game that I want to develop, right now i'm creating the battle system

I'm a computer science student and right now I'm studying Java, so I decided to create a little game to train and develop my skills with OOP
I plan to expand the game even further but right now I'm facing a problem with a loop inside the game, if anyone can help, it would be great!
